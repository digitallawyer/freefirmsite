// This is the place to place Bootstrap's variables overrides.
// As example you can start by importing the _variables.scss file from one of the
// theme provided by https://bootswatch.com .


// Some customization of the container class to have a better display in the guide.
// Don't hesitate to remove it to have a standard Bootstrap behavior
